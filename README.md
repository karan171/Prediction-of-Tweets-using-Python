# Prediction-of-Tweets-using-Python
In this Problem, we build a machine learning model that predicts which Tweets are about real disasters andwhich one’s aren’t. We have a dataset of 10,000 tweets that were hand labeled.This is an NLP problem andwe will be using various methods to determine the accuracy with which we can predict this.
